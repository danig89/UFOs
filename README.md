# UFOs

## Pverview of Project
The purpose of this project was to develop an interactive webpage about UFOs sightings around the world.
<br>
<br>
The objectives were to:
- create a table using data stored in a JavaScript array,
- create filters to make the table react to user input,
- place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing,
- and customize the webpage using Bootstrap.

## Resources
- Data Sources: [data.js](static/js/data.js)
- Software: D3.js 4.11.0; Bootstrap 4.0.0; Visual Studio Code 1.53.2

## Results
The webpage can easily be used to filter through sightings of UFOs by Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. For example, entering a date will filter out all sightings for that specific day. In the example below, entering the date of 1/8/2010 returned results for sightings reported on that date.

<br>
The user can filter the result further by adding the city and state. In the example below, adding the additional filter of Fort Worth, TX returned all reported sighting for that location on 1/8/2010.

As more filters are added, the search is narrowed down to fit the search criteria.
